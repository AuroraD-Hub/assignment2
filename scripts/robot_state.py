This node simulates the robot state by defining battery level and new ontology needed.
For this purpose, it publishs to topics to which the state machine subscribes:
 1) *state/new_ontology*: it defines if a new ontology has to be loaded
 2) *state/battery_low*: it defines if battery level of the robot is low
